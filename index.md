## About Me

Nice to meet you! I am Minjoon (Miles) Choi, a senior undergraduate student majoring Computer Science & Engineering at Seoul
National University.
<br/><br/>
I am currently performing research on the behavior of language models, especially when facing external knowledge
that conflicts their internal memory or knowledge that is irrelevant from given queries.
I have a deep interest on enhancing the robustness and reliability of language models.
These days, I am expanding my area of interest to the concept of RALMs and how to make use of data in the process of pursuing more reliable AI.
<br/><br/>
Previously, I have worked for 3 years as a software developer at Dunamu, a Fin-Tech corporation that developed Korea's #1 digital
asset exchange Upbit. You can find out more about my professional experience in my CV.
<br/><br/>
***I am expecting to be a PhD applicant for 2026 Fall !***
