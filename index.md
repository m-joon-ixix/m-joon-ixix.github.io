## About Me

Nice to meet you! I am Minjoon (Miles) Choi, an undergraduate student majoring Computer Science & Engineering at <a href="https://en.snu.ac.kr/index.html" target="_blank">Seoul National University</a>. I am grateful to be working closely with <a href="https://llwang.net" target="_blank">Prof. Lucy Lu Wang</a>.
<br><br>
I perform research to make language models (LLMs, VLMs) more reliable and trustworthy. I have a deep interest on investigating:<br>
(1) how models handle knowledge in complex scenarios (e.g., knowledge conflicts)<br>
(2) the knowledge boundaries of language models (i.e., "knowing what models know")<br>
<br>
Recently, I am also interested in applying these multimodal language models to high-expertise domains such as finance, programming, and medical science.
<br><br>
Previously, I have worked for 3 years as a software engineer at <a href="https://www.dunamu.com/en" target="_blank">Dunamu</a>, a Fin-Tech corporation that developed Korea's #1 digital asset exchange <a href="https://upbit.com/home" target="_blank">Upbit</a>.
<br><br>
Please check my <a href="assets/files/minjoon-cv.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a> for detailed information!
<br><br>
✣ ***I am applying for Ph.D. programs to start in Fall 2026.***
