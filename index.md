## About Me

Nice to meet you! I am Minjoon (Miles) Choi, a senior undergraduate student majoring Computer Science & Engineering at Seoul

I am interested in and performing research on the behavior of language models, especially when facing external knowledge
that conflicts with their internal parametric memory.
<br/><br/>
I have worked for 3 years as a software developer at Dunamu, a Fin-Tech corporation that developed Korea's #1 digital
asset exchange Upbit.
