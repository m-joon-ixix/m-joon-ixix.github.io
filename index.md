## About Me

Nice to meet you! I am Minjoon (Miles) Choi, a senior undergraduate student majoring Computer Science & Engineering at Seoul
National University.
<br/><br/>
I am performing research on the behavior of language models, especially when facing external knowledge
that conflicts their internal memory or knowledge that is irrelevant from the given questions.
I have a deep interest on enhancing the robustness and reliability of language models.

I have worked for 3 years as a software developer at Dunamu, a Fin-Tech corporation that developed Korea's #1 digital
